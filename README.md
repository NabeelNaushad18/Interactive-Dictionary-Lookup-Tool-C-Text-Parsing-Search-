Designed and implemented a robust dictionary search application in C++ that loads English words along with their types and definitions from a structured text file. The program stores each word as a struct and manages them in an STL vector. It features a user-interactive loop for querying words, supports case-insensitive search, and gracefully handles unexpected inputs including special characters and numbers. The core functionality is encapsulated in a single main.cpp file, supported by test files, dictionary data, sample input, and output examples for validation and demonstration. The application parses 4-line formatted entries and efficiently maps user input to dictionary entries.
